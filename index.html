        The family 8mm transfer project is complete. Dad had taken over 100 reels during a 27 year period, which resulted in almost six hours of footage. Where hosting 15 or so minutes of footage was feasible, hosting all of the footage is extremely expensive. Mom did not want the videos on YouTube, which we can all respect. So, if you'd like a copy of the vidoes on a USB flash drive, let me know.
