<h1>Hey! You found me!</h1>
</div>
</center>
<p>If you had bookmarked this page to access the family videos, I apologize. Before mom started really declining, she requested I take them down. It also became really expensive to host everything. If you want any family footage, reach out! We'll figure out a way to get it to you.</p>
<h1>This Page Isn't Dead...And It's 2025...</h1>
<p>...and the world is literally burning down all around us. I had to find ways to stop participating in the madness, so I deactivated my Facebook account, which I may come to regret soon. Boastfully ending their DEI programs and banning fact-checking were just the last of many final straws. In reality, I was just a spectator anyhow.</p>
<h1>Nobody Cares, Steven!</h1>
<p>I know, and I can't imagine anyone wanting to contact me doesn't already have my contact info. Just in case, though, I'm hosting this page.</p>
<p>Sharing my address? That's crazy! Not really...when you have a house, it's all a matter of public record.</p>
<h1>Anyhow...</h1>
<p>...If you're looking for Steven Arenz, originally from MN, relocated to TX, maybe played in a pit band for you or something, you probably found the right page.</p>
<p>My cell number has been the same since 2004. Email or send me a letter, if you need it.</p>
<p>You can find me at:</p>
<p style="line-height: 0;">1331 Boyd Dr</p>
