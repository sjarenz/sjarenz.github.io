        This page/site is a work in progress.  The newest vidoes will be posted on this landing page, and an archive of vidoes will be on a separate page.  My goal is to transfer all of our family video memories and to share them here.  I have the equipment to properly archive VHS, Hi-8 (those weird, little tapes dad's video camera used), Audio Cassettes, and 8mm (and Super 8 Film).  Let me know if you have any, and I'll add them to the pipline.
        <p>
        Videos should play at full quality, right from this page.  Watch them in full screen or download the files! I'll compile DVDs, once the library has been transferred and the video clips have been put in chronological order.
